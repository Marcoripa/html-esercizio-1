        <h2>Why only wine wankers dislike sweet wines</h2>
        <p> Long story short, sweet wines are delicious. Also, if you are having a cake, you can only match it with a sweet wine (unless it is a chocolate one).<br>
            Ok, but which one should I buy? Here a short list of my three favorite sweeties:
            <ul>
                <li>Moscato d'Asti</li>
                <li>Mosel Riesling SpatlÃ«se</li>
                <li>Rutherglen</li>
            </ul>
           Of course, Moscato is my favorite. If someone tries to tell you that it not good for you, or not fancy enough, you can easily win the discussion by answering 
           to fuck off. 
           If you are keen to drop some proper money, good Mosel Riesling is literally nectar of God. Also, it is a love potion.
           The third one is only if you like strong stuff like Porto. Alternatevely, Vin Santo is also a good option. Great with almond pastries.

           Following there is a list of random photos that I add just because I was asked to.
